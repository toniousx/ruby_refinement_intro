puts "my_has is has a symbol as key, is using one pice in memory as the obect id is not changing, this is the new syntax and recomended one instead using a string"
puts "my_hash2 is the old syntax that we also can use, also we use this syntax when we pass other keys as numbers, hashes, floats, strings "
